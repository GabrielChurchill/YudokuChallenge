What looks off right now

There’s a large white gutter below the grid inside the card (visible bar at the bottom). It feels like unused space and makes the board look slightly “lifted.”

The HUD (timer/mistakes/hints) and the grid don’t share the same internal rhythm: padding above the grid is larger than below.

Quick wins (visual polish)

Remove/normalize the bottom gutter inside the card so top/bottom padding match:

.game-card__board { padding: 12px 12px 12px; } /* not bigger at bottom */


Timer typography: make digits align/animate less:

.timer { font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; }


Grid line weights: lighten inner lines, keep 3×3 separators bold for clarity.

Shadow/radius: ensure the card’s shadow is subtle and the grid doesn’t cast an extra shadow that competes with the card.

Interaction/Usability

Selected cell aids: highlight row, column, and 3×3 box of the focused cell.

Keypad states: show selected number, disable numbers that are “complete,” and display a small count remaining (e.g., “5× left”).

Notes mode: a clear toggle (Notes/Ink). Long-press on keypad to switch is a nice bonus.

Error feedback: brief shake/flash on invalid placements; keep it gentle.

Layout & responsiveness

Cap card width (e.g., 720–800px) so the grid never feels tiny on ultrawide screens.

Ensure the board still sizes from available height minus keypad (you’ve fixed this—keep 100dvh/safe-area math).

Keep the keypad pinned and never overlapping; add padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) for iOS.

Accessibility

Keyboard input: 1–9 keys fill, arrows move; Esc clears selection.

Focus rings on cells and keypad buttons; minimum 44×44 px targets.

Contrast: timer and “Mistakes 0/3” should pass WCAG 4.5:1 in both light and gradient backgrounds.

ARIA: group the board (role="grid", cells as role="gridcell"), announce errors via aria-live="polite".

Guardrails / tests to add

Extend your Playwright spec to assert:

Equal top/bottom padding inside .game-card__board (or that the grid bottom ≈ card content bottom within 1px).

Containment still true (grid fully inside card).

Keyboard interactions (press “5”, confirm a “5” appears in the focused cell).

Focus visibility (snapshot a focused cell and expect visible outline).
